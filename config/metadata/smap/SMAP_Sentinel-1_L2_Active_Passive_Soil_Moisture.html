<p>Temporal coverage: 1 April 2015 to present</p>
<p>The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)/Sentinel-1 &quot;Soil Moisture (L2, Active-Passive, Radiometer and Radar)&quot; layer displays surface soil moisture in cm<sup>3</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup> posted on a 3 km EASE-Grid 2.0. L-band brightness temperatures from the SMAP radiometer during 6:00 a.m. descending half-orbit passes and C-band backscatter coefficients from the Copernicus Sentinel-1A and -1B radar are used to derive soil moisture data.</p>
<p>This data set contains modified Copernicus Sentinel-1 data (2015-present), acquired by the European Space Agency (ESA), distributed through the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF), and processed by the SMAP Science Data System.</p>
